# Traffic Prediction Model

## Overview
This project implements a Traffic Prediction Model using Python to predict traffic volume based on various features such as time of day, day of the week, and month. The model utilizes a Random Forest Regressor for making predictions on synthetic traffic data.

## Installation
To run this model, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Data Generation
In this implementation, synthetic traffic data is generated using a Poisson distribution to simulate hourly traffic volumes over a year.

## Feature Engineering
The model extracts the following features from the date:
- **hour**: The hour of the day (0-23).
- **day_of_week**: The day of the week (0=Monday, 6=Sunday).
- **month**: The month of the year (1-12).

## Model Training and Evaluation
1. **Train-Test Split**: The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
2. **Model**: A Random Forest Regressor with 100 trees is used for prediction.
3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - RÂ² Score

## Usage
To use the model, copy the provided code into your Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook or Python script) and run it. You can modify the synthetic data generation part to load your actual traffic dataset when you're ready.

## Visualization
Results are visualized using Matplotlib, including:
- A scatter plot comparing true vs. predicted traffic volumes.
- A bar chart displaying feature importances.
