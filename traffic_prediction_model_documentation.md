## Overview
This document provides an overview of the Traffic Prediction Model implemented using Python. The model predicts traffic volume based on various features such as time of day, day of the week, and month.

## Introduction
The Traffic Prediction Model aims to estimate traffic volume using historical data and predictive modeling techniques. It utilizes a Random Forest Regressor for predictions.

## Installation
To run this model, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Data Generation
In this implementation, synthetic traffic data is generated using a Poisson distribution to simulate hourly traffic volumes over a year.

## Feature Engineering
The following features are extracted from the date:
- **hour**: The hour of the day (0-23).
- **day_of_week**: The day of the week (0=Monday, 6=Sunday).
- **month**: The month of the year (1-12).

## Model Training and Evaluation
1. **Train-Test Split**: The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
2. **Model**: A Random Forest Regressor with 100 trees is used for prediction.
3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - RÂ² Score

## Visualization
Results are visualized using Matplotlib:
- Scatter plot comparing true vs. predicted traffic volumes.
- Bar chart displaying feature importances.

## Usage
To use the model, copy the provided code into your Python environment and run it. Adjust the synthetic data generation part to load your real traffic dataset when you're ready.
